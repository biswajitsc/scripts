# scripts
My frequently used scripts for quick access.
* ```convert_mnist.py```: Converts the binary formatted mnist dataset to a numpy array and dumps into a pickle file.
* ```make_word2vec_text.c```: Converts google's binary formatted word2vec file to an easily readable text format.
* ```remote_server_mount.sh```: Mounts a remote folder at a specified remote system (given ssh username and server ip address) to a specified folder in the local system using sshfs.
* ```git_author_rewrite.sh```: Rewrites the old author credentials with new author credentials. Useful if previous commits have been committed using a wrong email address.
